If you check this box, Jenkins will wait until <I>DeployHub</I> has finished running the deployment before
continuing. The deployment log will be recorded in the Jenkins console output.<br><br>
If you leave this box unchecked, the deployment will run in background and Jenkins will continue with
the next steps. Only the deployment ID will be recorded in the Jenkins console output - you can find the full
