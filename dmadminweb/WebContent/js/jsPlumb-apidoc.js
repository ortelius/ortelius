// ---------------- JSPLUMB ----------------------------------------

/**
 * Class: jsPlumb
 * The jsPlumb engine, of which there is one instance registered as a static object in the window.  You
 * can use the jsPlumb.getInstance function to get a new instance of jsPlumb. This object contains all of the methods you will use to create and maintain Connections and Endpoints.
 */

/*
 * Function: bind(event, callback)
 * Bind to an event on jsPlumb.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	event - the event to bind.  Available events on jsPlumb are:
 *         - *connection* 			: 	notification that a new Connection was established.  jsPlumb passes the new Connection to the callback.
 *         - *connectionDetached* 	: 	notification that a Connection was detached.  jsPlumb passes the detached Connection to the callback.
 *         - *click*						:	notification that a Connection was clicked.  jsPlumb passes the Connection that was clicked to the callback.
 *         - *dblclick*						:	notification that a Connection was double clicked.  jsPlumb passes the Connection that was double clicked to the callback.
 *         - *endpointClick*				:	notification that an Endpoint was clicked.  jsPlumb passes the Endpoint that was clicked to the callback.
 *         - *endpointDblClick*				:	notification that an Endpoint was double clicked.  jsPlumb passes the Endpoint that was double clicked to the callback.
 *         - *beforeDrop*					: 	notification that a Connection is about to be dropped. Returning false from this method cancels the drop. jsPlumb passes { sourceId, targetId, scope, connection, dropEndpoint } to your callback. For more information, refer to the jsPlumb documentation.
 *         - *beforeDetach*					: 	notification that a Connection is about to be detached. Returning false from this method cancels the detach. jsPlumb passes the Connection to your callback. For more information, refer to the jsPlumb documentation.
 *		   - *connectionDrag* 				:   notification that an existing Connection is being dragged. jsPlumb passes the Connection to your callback function.
 *         - *connectionDragEnd*            :   notification that the drag of an existing Connection has ended.  jsPlumb passes the Connection to your callback function.
 *
 *  callback - function to callback. This function will be passed the Connection/Endpoint that caused the event, and also the original event.

  	params - Object containing Endpoint constructor arguments.  For more information, see <Endpoint>.
  	referenceParams - Object containing more Endpoint constructor arguments; it will be merged with params by jsPlumb.  You would use this if you had some
  					  shared parameters that you wanted to reuse when you added Endpoints to a number of elements. The allowed values in
  					  this object are anything that 'params' can contain.  See <Endpoint>.

  Returns:
  	The newly created <Endpoint>, if el referred to a single element.  Otherwise, an array of newly created <Endpoint>s.

  /*
    Function: animate
    This is a wrapper around the supporting library's animate function; it injects a call to jsPlumb in the 'step' function (creating
    the 'step' function if necessary). This only supports the two-arg version of the animate call in jQuery, the one that takes an 'options' object as
    the second arg. MooTools has only one method, a two arg one. Which is handy.  YUI has a one-arg method, so jsPlumb merges 'properties' and 'options' together for YUI.

    Parameters:
    	el - Element to animate. Either an id, or a selector representing the element.
    	properties - The 'properties' argument you want passed to the library's animate call.
     	options - The 'options' argument you want passed to the library's animate call.

   /*
     Function: connect (params, [referenceParams])
     Establishes a <Connection> between two elements (or <Endpoint>s, which are themselves registered to elements).

     Parameters:
       params - Object containing constructor arguments for the Connection. See <Connection>'s constructor documentation.
       referenceParams - Optional object containing more constructor arguments for the Connection. Typically you would pass in data that a lot of
       Connections are sharing here, such as connector style etc, and then use the main params for data specific to this Connection.

   Function: detach(connection, [params])
   Detaches and then removes a <Connection>.

/*
 * Property: Defaults
 *
 * These are the default settings for jsPlumb.  They are what will be used if you do not supply specific pieces of information
 * to the various API calls. A convenient way to implement your own look and feel can be to override these defaults
 * by including a script somewhere after the jsPlumb include, but before you make any calls to jsPlumb.
 *
 * Properties:
 * 	-	*Anchor*				    The default anchor to use for all connections (both source and target). Default is "BottomCenter".
 * 	-	*Anchors*				    The default anchors to use ([source, target]) for all connections. Defaults are ["BottomCenter", "BottomCenter"].
 *  -   *ConnectionsDetachable*		Whether or not connections are detachable by default (using the mouse). Defaults to true.
 *  -   *ConnectionOverlays*		The default overlay definitions for Connections. Defaults to an empty list.

 *  -   *Container*				Optional selector or element id that instructs jsPlumb to append elements it creates to a specific element.
 *	-	*DoNotThrowErrors*		Defaults to false; whether or not to throw errors if a user specifies an unknown anchor, endpoint or connector type.
 * 	-	*DragOptions*			The default drag options to pass in to connect, makeTarget and addEndpoint calls. Default is empty.
 * 	-	*DropOptions*			The default drop options to pass in to connect, makeTarget and addEndpoint calls. Default is empty.
 * 	-	*Endpoint*				The default endpoint definition to use for all connections (both source and target).  Default is "Dot".
 *  -   *EndpointOverlays*		The default overlay definitions for Endpoints. Defaults to an empty list.
 * 	-	*Endpoints*				The default endpoint definitions ([ source, target ]) to use for all connections.  Defaults are ["Dot", "Dot"].
 * 	-	*EndpointStyle*			The default style definition to use for all endpoints. Default is fillStyle:"#456".
 * 	-	*EndpointStyles*		The default style definitions ([ source, target ]) to use for all endpoints.  Defaults are empty.
 * 	-	*EndpointHoverStyle*	The default hover style definition to use for all endpoints. Default is null.
 * 	-	*EndpointHoverStyles*	The default hover style definitions ([ source, target ]) to use for all endpoints. Defaults are null.
 * 	-	*HoverPaintStyle*		The default hover style definition to use for all connections. Defaults are null.
 * 	-	*LabelStyle*			The default style to use for label overlays on connections.
 * 	-	*LogEnabled*			Whether or not the jsPlumb log is enabled. defaults to false.
 * 	-	*Overlays*				The default overlay definitions (for both Connections and Endpoint). Defaults to an empty list.
 * 	-	*MaxConnections*		The default maximum number of connections for an Endpoint.  Defaults to 1.
 * 	-	*PaintStyle*			The default paint style for a connection. Default is line width of 8 pixels, with color "#456".
 * 	-	*ReattachConnections*	Whether or not to reattach Connections that a user has detached with the mouse and then dropped. Default is false.
 * 	-	*RenderMode*			What mode to use to paint with.  If you're on IE<9, you don't really get to choose this.  You'll just get VML.  Otherwise, the jsPlumb default is to use SVG.
 * 	-	*Scope*				The default "scope" to use for connections. Scope lets you assign connections to different categories.

       *  el		-	string id or element selector for the element to make a source.
       * 	params	-	JS object containing parameters:
       * 	  - *endpoint*	optional.	specification of an endpoint to create when a connection is created.
       * 	  - *parent*	optional.   the element to add Endpoints to when a Connection is established.  if you omit this,

// ---------------- ENDPOINT -----------------------------------------------------

/*
 * Class: Endpoint
 *
 * Models an endpoint. Can have 1 to 'maxConnections' Connections emanating from it (set maxConnections to -1
 * to allow unlimited).  Typically, if you use 'jsPlumb.connect' to programmatically connect two elements, you won't
 * actually deal with the underlying Endpoint objects.  But if you wish to support drag and drop Connections, one of the ways you
 * do so is by creating and registering Endpoints using 'jsPlumb.addEndpoint', and marking these Endpoints as 'source' and/or
 * 'target' Endpoints for Connections.
 *
 * You never need to create one of these directly; jsPlumb will create them as needed.

*/

/*
 * Function: Endpoint
 *
 * Endpoint constructor.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * anchor - definition of the Anchor for the endpoint.  You can include one or more Anchor definitions here; if you include more than one, jsPlumb creates a 'dynamic' Anchor, ie. an Anchor which changes position relative to the other elements in a Connection.  Each Anchor definition can be either a string nominating one of the basic Anchors provided by jsPlumb (eg. "TopCenter"), or a four element array that designates the Anchor's location and orientation (eg, and this is equivalent to TopCenter, [ 0.5, 0, 0, -1 ]).  To provide more than one Anchor definition just put them all in an array. You can mix string definitions with array definitions.
 * endpoint - optional Endpoint definition. This takes the form of either a string nominating one of the basic Endpoints provided by jsPlumb (eg. "Rectangle"), or an array containing [name,params] for those cases where you don't wish to use the default values, eg. [ "Rectangle", { width:5, height:10 } ].
 * enabled - optional, defaults to true. Indicates whether or not the Endpoint should be enabled for mouse events (drag/drop).
 * paintStyle - endpoint style, a js object. may be null.
 * hoverPaintStyle - style to use when the mouse is hovering over the Endpoint. A js object. may be null; defaults to null.
 * cssClass - optional CSS class to set on the display element associated with this Endpoint.
 * hoverClass - optional CSS class to set on the display element associated with this Endpoint when it is in hover state.
 * source - element the Endpoint is attached to, of type String (an element id) or element selector. Required.
 * canvas - canvas element to use. may be, and most often is, null.
 * container - optional id or selector instructing jsPlumb where to attach the element it creates for this endpoint.  you should read the documentation for a full discussion of this.
 * connections - optional list of Connections to configure the Endpoint with.
 * isSource - boolean. indicates the endpoint can act as a source of new connections. Optional; defaults to false.
 * maxConnections - integer; defaults to 1.  a value of -1 means no upper limit.
 * dragOptions - if isSource is set to true, you can supply arguments for the underlying library's drag method. Optional; defaults to null.
 * connectorStyle - if isSource is set to true, this is the paint style for Connections from this Endpoint. Optional; defaults to null.
 * connectorHoverStyle - if isSource is set to true, this is the hover paint style for Connections from this Endpoint. Optional; defaults to null.
 * connector - optional Connector type to use.  Like 'endpoint', this may be either a single string nominating a known Connector type (eg. "Bezier", "Straight"), or an array containing [name, params], eg. [ "Bezier", { curviness:160 } ].
 * connectorOverlays - optional array of Overlay definitions that will be applied to any Connection from this Endpoint.
 * connectorClass - optional CSS class to set on Connections emanating from this Endpoint.
 * connectorHoverClass - optional CSS class to set on to set on Connections emanating from this Endpoint when they are in hover state.
 * connectionsDetachable - optional, defaults to true. Sets whether connections to/from this Endpoint should be detachable or not.
 * isTarget - boolean. indicates the endpoint can act as a target of new connections. Optional; defaults to false.
 * dropOptions - if isTarget is set to true, you can supply arguments for the underlying library's drop method with this parameter. Optional; defaults to null.
 * reattach - optional boolean that determines whether or not the Connections reattach after they have been dragged off an Endpoint and left floating. defaults to false: Connections dropped in this way will just be deleted.
 * parameters - Optional JS object containing parameters to set on the Endpoint. These parameters are then available via the getParameter method.  When a connection is made involving this Endpoint, the parameters from this Endpoint are copied into that Connection. Source Endpoint parameters override target Endpoint parameters if they both have a parameter with the same name.
 * connector-pointer-events - Optional. a value for the 'pointer-events' property of any SVG elements that are created to render connections from this endoint.

/*
*	Property: target
*	The target element for this Connection.

/*
* Property: overlays
* List of Overlays for this component.
*/

/*
 * Function: Connection
 * Connection constructor. You should not ever create one of these directly. If you make a call to jsPlumb.connect, all of
 * the parameters that you pass in to that function will be passed to the Connection constructor; if your UI
 * uses the various Endpoint-centric methods like addEndpoint/makeSource/makeTarget, along with drag and drop,
 * then the parameters you set on those functions are translated and passed in to the Connection constructor. So
 * you should check the documentation for each of those methods.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	source 	- either an element id, a selector for an element, or an Endpoint.
 * 	target	- either an element id, a selector for an element, or an Endpoint
 * 	scope	- scope descriptor for this connection. optional.
 *  container - optional id or selector instructing jsPlumb where to attach all the elements it creates for this connection.  you should read the documentation for a full discussion of this.
 *  detachable - optional, defaults to true. Defines whether or not the connection may be detached using the mouse.
 *  reattach	- optional, defaults to false. Defines whether not the connection should be retached if it was dragged off an Endpoint and then dropped in whitespace.
 *  endpoint - Optional. Endpoint definition to use for both ends of the connection.
 *  endpoints - Optional. Array of two Endpoint definitions, one for each end of the Connection. This and 'endpoint' are mutually exclusive parameters.
 *  endpointStyle - Optional. Endpoint style definition to use for both ends of the Connection.
 *  endpointStyles - Optional. Array of two Endpoint style definitions, one for each end of the Connection. This and 'endpoint' are mutually exclusive parameters.
 *  paintStyle - Parameters defining the appearance of the Connection. Optional; jsPlumb will use the defaults if you supply nothing here.
 *  hoverPaintStyle - Parameters defining the appearance of the Connection when the mouse is hovering over it. Optional; jsPlumb will use the defaults if you supply nothing here (note that the default hoverPaintStyle is null).
 *  cssClass - optional CSS class to set on the display element associated with this Connection.
 *  hoverClass - optional CSS class to set on the display element associated with this Connection when it is in hover state.
 *  overlays - Optional array of Overlay definitions to appear on this Connection.
 *  drawEndpoints - if false, instructs jsPlumb to not draw the endpoints for this Connection.  Be careful with this: it only really works when you tell jsPlumb to attach elements to the document body. Read the documentation for a full discussion of this.
 *  parameters - Optional JS object containing parameters to set on the Connection. These parameters are then available via the getParameter method.

/*
* Function: getParameter(key)
* Gets the named parameter; returns null if no parameter with that name is set.
