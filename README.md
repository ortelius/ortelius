# Ortelius
Welcome to Ortelius. Ortelius is an open source project that aims to simplify the implementation of microservices. By providing a central catalog of services with their deployment specs, application teams can easily consume and deploy services across cluster. Ortelius tracks application versions based on service updates and maps their service dependencies eliminating confusion and guess work.  Unique to Ortelius is the ability to track your microservice inventory across clusters mapping the differences.  Ortelius serves Site Reliability Engineers and Cloud Architects in their migration to and ongoing management of a microservice implementation. For more information, see the comprehensive documentation at http://docs.ortelius.io 

## Ortelius Goals
The goals of the Ortelius Open Source Project are: 

1) Simplify deployment automation across the life cycle in traditional, hybrid and microservice environments.
2) Allow organizations to achieve business agility by providing a clear path for fast and safe incremental releases with impact analysis and feedback loops. 
3) Give developers the power to control how their software is released across all environments by defining deployment configurations data that is separate from the definition.   
4) Deliver transparency into the deployment process by mapping component and microservice relationships with BOM and Difference Reports across deployed environments (clusters, cloud, physical).  
5) Establish a market place to share microservices with their deployment requirements and versions.

## Open Source Sub-Committees

### CD Environment - Development Infrastructure and Productivity

Create a CD process for managing pull requests, builds, tests and releases.  

Contributors:
- Anand Bhagwat
- Steve Taylor
- Sanjay Sheel

### Data Science and Visualization

Determine what reports and maps can currently be created and/or enhanced.  Begin looking at what data can be passed back to the CD pipelines for predictive reporting, risk assessment. (Think truth tables).

Contributors:
- Tracy Ragan

### Deployment Integrations

Create integrations with documentation and videos for the following CI/CD Solutions:

- Jenkins: 90% work completed
- Jenkins X
- Screwdriver
- Tekton (Tekton Catalog)
- Spinnaker
- Argo
