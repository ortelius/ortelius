# Ortelius

Welcome to Ortelius. Ortelius is a unified 'evidence store' of supply chain data designed to simplify a decoupled microservices environment. Ortelius builds relationships between service (package) and consuming 'logical' applications. With Ortelius, open-source and API developers can register their services and track their consumers. Enterprise developers register their 'logical' application's base version and are notified when a dependency change causes the creation of a new application version, new SBOM, CVE, and dependency map. By centralizing and tracking detailed supply chain data, Ortelius provides the enterprise open-source consumers and open-source developers a coordinated view of who is using a service, its version, and inventory across all end-points. We are creating a central store for development teams to define provenance, apply zero-trust policies, and eventually score risk factors of both internal common code and open-source packages. In other words, we answer the question, "who is using Log4j." For more information, see the comprehensive documentation at [Ortelius' documentation](http://docs.ortelius.io).

## Ortelius Mission

Our mission is to simplify the adoption of modern architecture through a world-class microservice governance catalog driven by a supportive and diverse global open source community.

## Ortelius Value Statements

- We want Members to learn and understand solutions around microservice use and their challenges through a diverse contributor base.
- We want our members to develop their careers, skills and gain community recognition for their work and expertise.
- We want our members to have the opportunity to share and reuse open source microservices to further the adoption of a cloud native development.
- We want members to learn how to contribute to an open source community and become part of the broader conversation around cloud native architecture.

## Ortelius Benefits

The benefits of the Ortelius Open Source Project are:

1) Adds automated supply chain management of microservices and other shared components across application teams
2) Tracks the 'blast radius' of a single shared component across all consuming applications that are using it. 
3) Tracks the logical applications and aggregates component SBOM and CVE data to the logical applicaiton level. 
4) Simplifies the path to adopting cloud native development practices without a major redesign of their CD pipeline.
5) Performs container versioning and applicaiton pakcage versions. 
6) Serve as a central market place to share reusable components with their SBOM and CVE information.
